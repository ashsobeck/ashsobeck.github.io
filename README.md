## Sources

There are a few sources that I used, namely a starter template from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_portfolio&stacked=h) and [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/). 

I took the template and modified it as I saw fit.
